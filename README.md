# Product recall alerts API

Part of a full stack project (FastAPI, Apache Cordova (currently replacing with a more modern framework), Postgres and Python).

This is a REST API developed using Fast API. Allows users to register for food and drug recall alerts (UK products only). Users can also subscribe or unsubscribe for recall alerts for specific products and remove their details entirely if they no longer need the service.

Still in development.
